## üß¨ About ACF Block Creator

This package simplifies block creation for Gutengberg editor in WordPress using Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
It extends functonality of [Block Loader](https://github.com/micropackage/block-loader) package and is intended to use alongside it.

This package will automatically create a block template file with basic markup for ACF fields while creating a field group for a block.

## üíæ Installation

``` bash
composer require --dev micropackage/acf-block-creator
```

## üïπ Usage

Before you can start creating blocks this package needs to be initialized:
```php
Micropackage\ACFBlockCreator\ACFBlockCreator::init( [
	'blocks_dir'            => 'blocks',
	'scss_dir'              => false,
	'default_category'      => 'common',
	'block_container_class' => 'block-inner',
	'package'               => true,
	'license'               => 'GPL-3.0-or-later',
] );
```

Only thing to do is to create new ACF field group which name starts with "Block:". It will automatically create a block template file and set the field group location to this created block.

Block params (block name, slug, category etc.) can be adjusted using additional fields at the bottom of field group creation form.

### Silent initialization

Since this is a development package and is not useful in production environment we probably don't want it's initialization code in the production package of our theme.
That's why this package will be automatically initialized by [Block Loader](https://github.com/micropackage/block-loader) if both packages will be present.

So if we will add this as dev dependency and then run `composer install --no-dev` this package will not be present and just won't get loaded by BlockLoader.

All configuration params of this package can be then passed directly to `BlockLoader::init` method.

Also `blocks_dir` param will not be necessary since it will automatically get the value of `dir` param for BlockLoader.
If you configure a custom category it will also be automatically used as default category for new blocks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

## üì¶ About the Micropackage project

Micropackages - as the name suggests - are micro packages with a tiny bit of reusable code, helpful particularly in WordPress development.

The aim is to have multiple packages which can be put together to create something bigger by defining only the structure.
